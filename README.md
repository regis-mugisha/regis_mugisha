# Simple Express.js App with Docker & NGINX Reverse Proxy

This project demonstrates building a basic Node.js app using Express.js, containerizing it with Docker, and configuring NGINX as a reverse proxy.  
The app listens on port 3000 and responds with **"Hello, Devops!"**.  
NGINX forwards traffic from port 80 to the app.

**Tools used:**  
- Node.js  
- Docker  
- NGINX
